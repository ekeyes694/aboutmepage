  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hey! I'm an easy going person always looking for a laugh and some fun with good people.  I work as a server at Texas Roadhouse and hopefully soon to be a UM Coordinator at BMCHP (fingers crossed).  </p>
  <p>I love technology and the web with the endless posibilities there are to create and explore.  Having access to these resources makes being alive now an amazing experience, mostly because of how much help it can offer others.</p>
  <p>What I love even more are my friends and family, and the experiences we've shared.  Need to appreciate the little things that make you happy and keep you going.</p>

  <h1>Born and Raised</h1>
  <p>I come from a small suburb close to Boston called Walpole.  I've lived here my whole life with no complaints, but still cannot wait to move somewhere else in the country.</p>
